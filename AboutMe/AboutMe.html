Greetings, my name is Venus Brown and I am consistent with reinventing myself.
Over the years I have had the opportunity to travel internationally while raising
a family and going to school. 
My career started in health care as a paramedic in Philadelphia, PA and went into 
Early Childhood Education as soon as my family started to grow. I have worked in 
mortgage industry as a HUD Certified Housing and Mortgage Processor. Now I am
embarking on my latest advernture with Augusta Technical College for Coding Bootcamp.
Wish me luck!
